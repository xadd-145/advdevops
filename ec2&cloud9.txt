EC2
The full form of Amazon EC2 is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud. Amazon EC2 is one of the most used and most basic services on Amazon
Amazon EC2 lets users launch and manage server instances, at any time and for as long as they need.
EC2 is a machine with an operating system and hardware components of your choice.
But the difference is that it is totally virtualized. 
EC2 enables on-demand, scalable computing capacity in the AWS cloud.

Cloud9
The AWS Cloud9 IDE offers a rich code-editing experience with support for several programming languages and runtime debuggers, as well as a built-in terminal. 
It contains a collection of tools that you use to code, build, run, test, and debug software, and helps you release software to the cloud.

Cloud9 is better than Ec2
